# Prší – Card Game Prototype

This repository contains a **school project from 2024**, developed in collaboration with students of the Graphic Art School Hellichova in Prague.  
The goal was to demonstrate how 2D assets can be prepared by graphic artists and implemented into a working web game.

---

## Project Description

The project was organized as a year-long collaboration between two classes:

1. **Computer Graphics students (Adobe Illustrator)**  
   - Designed 32 unique playing cards.  
   - Focus on readability of typography, consistent color palette, and individual stylization.  
   - Assets were exported on 32 artboards with consistent naming conventions.  
   - Some students prepared both RGB (for web) and CMYK (for print) versions.

2. **Digital Media Design students (Programming / OOP principles)**  
   - Implemented the card game logic using object-oriented programming.  
   - The `Card` class served as an example of inheritance and polymorphism.  
   - The game logic brought the graphic assets to life.

## Features
- 32 custom designed playing cards by art students.  
- Implementation of OOP principles (inheritance, polymorphism).  
- Basic animations and sounds for an interactive experience.  
- Demonstrates the **asset pipeline**: from Illustrator → export → integration into a web environment.

---

## Purpose
This project is a **simple card game prototype** created as a showcase for an **asset pack designed by students**.  
It serves as both a presentation of their work and as an example of how graphic assets can be brought into a small game project.

## Future Development
The project is currently being ported into **Unity**, where we are focusing on:
- Implementing the same card logic using C# and Unity OOP principles.  
- Using **Animator** and **Shader Graph** for visual effects and interactivity.  
- Testing asset workflows from Illustrator → Unity pipeline.  

This continuation demonstrates how a simple web prototype can evolve into a Unity-based project with a professional asset integration workflow.
